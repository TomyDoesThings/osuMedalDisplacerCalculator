# osuMedalDisplacerCalculator

Hello. Are you an osu! medal hunter?

Have you pushed yourself to your limits hitting what you think is your maximum potential in medal percent?

Are you wondering how many doable medals would need to be released in a row in order for you to reach your dreamed of medal percent?

Well good news, I, Tomy, have finally decided to make a program that solves that for you.

Introducing osu! Medal Displacer Calculator...

there are two modes:

Percent - Finding the amount of doable medals that need to be released in a row for a certain medal percent.

Medal Literal - Finding the amount of doable medals that need to be released in a row for a medal percent that your desired medal count is.

I really hope this program is of use to anybody that needs to calculate the answer to that very final medal stretch, when you really think you have hit your limits.
